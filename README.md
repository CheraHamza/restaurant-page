## This a simple restaurant webpage.

# This project is done following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

# What I have learned:

I learned how to use webpack to manage a project (bundle code, manage assets...). 
I also learned how to use ES6 modules and separate my code to smaller and more manageable bits.
